ex1
Proof.
  intros A H1 H2.
  apply H1.
  intros H3.
  apply H3.
  apply H2.
Qed.

ex2
Proof.
  intros A B C.
  unfold not.
  intros [not_A not_B].
  destruct C as [A_true | B_true].
  - apply not_A in A_true. contradiction.
  - apply not_B in B_true. contradiction.
Qed.

ex3
Proof.
  intros T P H x P_x.
  apply H.
  exists x.
  exact P_x.
